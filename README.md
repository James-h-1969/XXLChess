# XXLChess

This was a project made for INFO1113 in order to learn the fundamentals of Java and Object Orientated Programing.
In order to play XXLChess, change the config.json file to your preferences. 
level1.txt holds the default position.

To start the game, type _"gradle run"_ in the terminal. Good luck and watchout for checkmate!
